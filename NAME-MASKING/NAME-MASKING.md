# PDF Text Processing and Name Masking

This repository contains a Python project that aims to load a PDF document with up to 1000 pages, extract the content of the first 100 pages, and perform named entity recognition (NER) to identify human names. Additionally, it masks these names, preserving the first and last letters.

## Requirements

Required dependencies:

- Python 3.9
- spaCy (for named entity recognition)
- pandas (for working with data frames)
- pdfminer (for parsing PDF files)
- PyPDF2 (for PDF manipulation)
- reportlab (for creating PDFs)
